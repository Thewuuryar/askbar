Rust total: 138 passed (1 ignored).

Notes:
- The task list names a standalone `import.rs` test file; at this commit there is none. The `import` tests are 1 unit test inside `askbar-server/src/import.rs`.
- The remote tag pushes (S2) were skipped on the user's instruction; tags exist locally only. The remote `server-client` branch was not deleted (S3), so `c75fb37` stays reachable.
- Tauri build needs GTK/WebKit dev packages (`libgtk-3-dev`, `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, etc.) in this container.

## Checkpoint R1 (T1)

- `cargo build --workspace`, `cargo test --workspace`: 137 passed, 0 failed (baseline 138; the only difference is the 1 `import` unit test, removed with the feature).
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`: no errors; 6 style warnings that predate R1 (e.g. `useless_format`, `needless_question_mark`). No `dead_code` warnings remain.
- Node: markdown 19, ui 39, admin 23, all passing, equal to baseline.
- R1.1: the task names tests for `create-pair-code`; none existed, so none were removed.
- R1.3: clippy reported one dead item, `TokenStore::clear`; it was removed with its `allow(dead_code)`. The `allow(dead_code)` at `backend.rs:70` is left for R2.4, which deletes that code.
